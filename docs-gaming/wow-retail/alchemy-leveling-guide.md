## Leveling Path (1-100)

### Level 1-25: Basic Potions

**Recommended Crafts:**
1. **2x Refreshing Healing Potion** - Basic healing potion
2. **2x Aerated Mana Potion** - Basic mana potion
3. Use **Reclaim Concoctions** on the potions you crafted to recover materials

**Materials Needed:**
- Various basic herbs (Mycobloom, etc.)
- Check with trainer for exact requirements

**Tips:**
- Craft the minimum needed to reach 25
- Save materials by using Reclaim Concoctions
- Yellow recipes still give skill points but less frequently

### Level 25-50: First Specialization + Experimentation

**Unlock:** First Specialization at 25

**Recommended Crafts:**
- **Algari Healing Potion** - Continues giving skill points
- **Basic Potion Experimentation** - Learns new recipes through experimentation
- **Flasks** - Start crafting flasks as they give 2 skill points per craft

**Experimentation System:**
- The War Within uses Experimentation instead of trainer-learned recipes
- Experiment on specific herbs to learn new recipes
- Each successful experiment teaches you a new potion/flask/phial recipe

**Materials Needed:**
- Mycobloom (common herb, used in most recipes)
- Arathor's Spear (uncommon)
- Blessing Blossom (uncommon)

### Level 75-100: Final Push

**Unlock:** Fourth Specialization at 75

**Recommended Crafts:**
- **Flasks** (yellow at 90, still give points)
- **Basic Phial Experimentation** (turns green 90-100)
- **Basic Potion Experimentation** (turns green 90-100)

**Important Notes:**
