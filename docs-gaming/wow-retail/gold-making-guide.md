# World of Warcraft Gold Making Guide

A comprehensive guide to making gold in World of Warcraft Retail, including profession recommendations, farming methods, and crafting strategies.

## Gold Making Approaches

There are three primary methods to earn gold in WoW:

### 1. Farming
The best entry-level method, farming current expansion materials typically sells quickly due to high demand. Materials from raids, dungeons, and open-world content are always in demand.

### 2. Crafting
Crafting offers the highest gold potential, especially early in a patch or expansion when you have access to highly sought-after recipes before the majority of crafters. Flasks, potions, and profession-specific items generate consistent income.

### 3. Auction House Flipping
Buy underpriced items and resell them for profit. While not ideal for beginners, once you understand market trends, it becomes one of the most time-efficient methods to earn thousands of gold without farming.

## Profession System Overview

### Primary Profession Limits
In WoW Retail, you can select **exactly two primary professions** per character. These can be any combination of:

- **Production Professions**: Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Enchanting, Engineering, Inscription, Jewelcrafting, Leatherworking, Tailoring
- **Gathering Professions**: Herbalism, Mining, Skinning

You cannot learn more than two primary professions on a single character.

### Secondary Professions
You can learn **all four secondary professions** with no limit:
- Cooking
- Fishing
- Archaeology
- First Aid

## Best Professions for Gold Making

### Alchemy (Production + Herbalism)
**Why**: Flasks, potions, and combat consumables are used on every raid boss pull, making this the most reliable high-volume market in the game.

**Gold Potential**: High and consistent - raiders require these items constantly throughout content patches.

**Recommended Pairing**: Herbalism (gathers materials for potions and flasks)

### Inscription (Production + Herbalism)
**Why**: Specialized items like Darkmoon Sigils and Vantus Runes are highly profitable. At the beginning of expansions, crafting a full Darkmoon Deck can sell for a fortune.

**Gold Potential**: Very high at patch launches, steady mid-patch

**Recommended Pairing**: Herbalism (supplies the herbs needed for inks)

### Herbalism (Gathering)
**Why**: Raw herb sales require zero setup and provide pure profit. Herb prices spike significantly at patch releases.

**Gold Potential**: High on new patches; steady but lower mid-patch

**Recommended Pairing**: Alchemy or Inscription

### Mining (Gathering)
**Why**: Raw ore is always in demand for crafters, particularly Blacksmithing and Engineering.

**Gold Potential**: Moderate to high depending on patch cycle

**Recommended Pairing**: Blacksmithing, Jewelcrafting, or Engineering

### Skinning (Gathering)
**Why**: Quick to farm, leather is essential for Leatherworking and Armor-crafting professions.

**Gold Potential**: Moderate; steady but lower volume than herbs/ore

## Current Patch Gold Making Methods (The War Within)

### Farming Locations

#### Siren Isle Farming
Farm **Flame-Blessed Iron** by participating in Siren Isle activities. The currency unlocks tradeable toys that sell well on the Auction House for significant profits.

#### Herb Farming (Isle of Dorn & Azure Span)
Target high-value herbs at new expansion launch or patch releases when prices peak. These feed Alchemy and Inscription crafters.

#### Skinning Routes
Farm wolves and other skinnable mobs in current expansion zones. Quick respawns provide consistent leather supply.

#### Housing & Lumber Farming (New)
The player housing patch created some of the most profitable gold-making opportunities in recent years:
- Farm lumber from housing activities
- Craft housing decor and furnishings
- Sell finished items on the Auction House for thousands of gold per piece

### Group Farming Methods

#### K'aresh Triangle BOE Farm
A high-level group farming method that generates significant gold/hour through dropping BOE (Bind on Equip) gear. Requires organized group coordination but highly profitable.

#### Darkflame Cleft Runs
Farm cloth in organized group runs. Excellent if you have Tailoring to convert drops into crafted items.

## Profession Pairing Recommendations

### Optimal Setup #1: Alchemy + Herbalism
**Best for**: Consistent, reliable income throughout expansions
- **Alchemy** crafts potions and flasks for raiders
- **Herbalism** supplies all needed materials
- Low setup required; always in-demand products

### Optimal Setup #2: Inscription + Herbalism
**Best for**: Aggressive early-patch profits
- **Inscription** creates specialized items and Darkmoon Decks
- **Herbalism** supplies inks and pigments
- High profits at patch launches, lower mid-patch

### Optimal Setup #3: Pure Gathering (Mining + Herbalism or Skinning + Mining)
**Best for**: Minimal effort, maximum flexibility
- No crafting required
- Highest value at patch launches
- Allows gold from all three primary methods on rotation

### Optimal Setup #4: Jewelcrafting + Mining
**Best for**: Raid-focused players
- Jewelry is essential for all content
- Consistent demand
- Mining supplies all materials

## Tips for Maximum Gold Income

1. **Patch Launch Strategy**: Level a gatherer first to capitalize on astronomical material prices at expansion/patch launches
2. **Market Knowledge**: Track prices on your realm and sell when values peak
3. **Secondary Professions**: Always take Cooking for flasks/feasts; Fishing provides rare catch-exclusive items
4. **Consistency**: The best gold-making method is one you enjoy—sustainable effort beats sporadic grinding
5. **Diversification**: Run multiple characters with different professions to cover multiple gold sources
6. **World Quests**: Casual players can supplement gold through daily world quests while leveling professions
