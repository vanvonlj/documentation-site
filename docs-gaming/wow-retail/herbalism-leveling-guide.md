### 5. Camouflaged Herbs

---

## Leveling Path (1-100)

### Level 1-30: All Herbs Give Skill Points

**Farming Strategy:**
- Pick everything you see
- **Mycobloom** stops giving skill points around 30
- Focus on questing through zones naturally
- No specific farming route needed yet

**Best Zones:**
- Isle of Dorn (starting zone)
- Any zone you're questing in

**Expected Time:** 30-45 minutes

### Level 30-60: Uncommon Herbs Priority

**Farming Strategy:**
- Normal versions of uncommon herbs give skill points until 60
- Prioritize: Arathor's Spear, Blessing Blossom, Orbinid, Luredrop
- Regular Mycobloom no longer gives points (stopped at ~30)
- Empowered nodes start becoming important

**Best Zones:**
- **The Ringing Deeps** (best node density)
- Hallowfall (good herb variety)
- Isle of Dorn (Arathor's Spear)

**Expected Time:** 30-45 minutes

### Level 60-100: Empowered & Modified Herbs Only

**Farming Strategy:**
- **Only** Empowered and Camouflaged herbs give skill points
- Regular herbs no longer provide skill gains
- Modified nodes (Altered, Crystallized, Irradiated, Sporefused, Camouflaged) are essential
- This is the slowest part of leveling

**Best Zone:**
- **The Ringing Deeps** - Highest density of herb nodes
- Underground layout concentrates spawns
- Easier to chain farming routes

**Modified Herb Spawns:**
- Spawn randomly instead of normal herbs
- No special farming route guarantees them
- Be patient and persistent
- Competition slows this process significantly

**Expected Time:** 1-2 hours (depending on competition and luck)

---

## Best Farming Routes

---

## Tips for Faster Leveling

### 1. Farm During Off-Peak Hours

- Late night (after midnight)
- Weekday afternoons
- Less competition = more nodes = faster leveling

### 2. Use Gathering Addons
- **GatherMate2** - Remembers node locations
- **Routes** - Optimizes farming paths
- **FarmHud** - Node tracking overlay
- **HandyNotes** - Marks treasures and rares

### 3. Movement Speed Increases
- **Druid Travel Form** (instant cast, best class for Herbalism)
- **Sky Riding** (faster than old flying)
- **Ground Mount Speed** gear
- Pathfinder achievement bonuses

### 4. Class Choice Matters
- **Druids** - Can gather in Travel Form (BEST)
- **Tauren** - Faster gathering racial
- Any class - Use Sky Riding for speed

### 5. Server Population
- Lower pop servers = less competition
- War Mode OFF = more players but safer
- War Mode ON = fewer players but PvP risk

---

## Dangerous Nodes Warning

### Windswept Herbs (Dragonflight - Not in TWW)

If you're leveling in Dragonflight zones:
- **Windswept herbs knock you back twice** after gathering
- If you're on high ground, you can die from fall damage
- Look for the wind visual effect
- Be ready to use Goblin Glider or slowfall abilities

The War Within doesn't have this specific mechanic, but always be aware of your surroundings.

---

## Leveling Multiple Expansions

### Current Content (The War Within)
- Learn The War Within Herbalism from Dornogal
- Levels 1-100 in current zones
- Best for current gold making

### Previous Expansions (Optional)
- **Dragonflight** - Dragon Isles Herbalism (1-100)
- **Shadowlands** - Shadowlands Herbalism (1-100)
- Each expansion has separate skill trees
- Not required unless farming old materials

**Note:** Focus on current expansion (The War Within) for best results.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Farming in high-competition areas** - Switch zones or times
2. **Ignoring Specializations** - They significantly boost gains
3. **Not using flight efficiently** - Sky Riding is much faster
4. **Vendoring Quality 3 herbs** - Sell on AH for much more
5. **Leveling during peak hours** - Wait for off-peak times
6. **Not tracking nodes** - Use GatherMate2 to learn spawns
7. **Giving up at 60-100** - This is normal, be patient

---

## Useful Addons

### Essential
- **GatherMate2** - Tracks herb node locations on map
- **Routes** - Generates optimal farming paths
- **TradeSkillMaster (TSM)** - Market prices and profit tracking

### Quality of Life
- **Auctionator** - Simplified auction house posting
- **FarmHud** - Heads-up display for nearby nodes
- **HandyNotes** - Shows treasures and rare spawns
- **TomTom** - Waypoint navigation

### Class-Specific
- **Druid** - No addons needed, gather in form

## Herbalism + Alchemy Synergy

If you're pairing with Alchemy:

### Benefits
- **Free materials** - No gold cost for leveling Alchemy
- **Immediate use** - Every herb you gather has purpose
- **Double profit** - Sell raw herbs OR craft into potions
- **Self-sufficient** - Never need to buy consumables

### Leveling Strategy
- Level both simultaneously while questing
- Gather herbs → Craft potions → Level both
- Use Bountiful Harvests to refine Q1 → Q3
- Craft with your own Q3 herbs for maximum quality

### Time Investment
- 3-5 hours total for both professions
- Can be done entirely through questing + light farming
- More efficient than leveling separately

---

## End Game Goals

Once you hit 100, focus on:

### Maximize Knowledge Points
- Complete all weekly quests
- Find all treasures
- Max out Bountiful Harvests
- Invest in gold-making specializations

### Efficient Farming
- Learn optimal routes for each zone
- Identify high-value herbs for your server
- Track market prices with TSM
- Farm during peak selling times

### Quality Over Quantity
- Focus on gathering Quality 3 herbs
- Use herb refinement from Bountiful Harvests
- Quality 3 sells for 2-3x more than Quality 1
- Build reputation as quality supplier

### Reputation Building
- Supply alchemists with bulk orders
- Offer competitive prices to regulars
- Build a customer base for steady income
- Consider personal work orders for guilds
